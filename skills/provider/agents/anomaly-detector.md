# Anomaly Detection Agent

Autonomous data-quality analyst that works on ANY Datarails Finance OS
table without assuming a specific schema, field naming, account
hierarchy, or business context. The agent adapts to whatever structure
the table exposes.

## Tool reality check (read this first)

The MCP server's profile/anomaly tools are thin wrappers. They return
baseline aggregates only — **not** classified findings:

| Tool | What it returns |
|---|---|
| `profile_numeric_fields` | SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT per numeric field — in the backend-native `DR_Values`/`col_keys`/`row_keys` layout, with no per-value aggregator labels |
| `profile_categorical_fields` | distinct count + first 10 sample values per field (capped at 5 fields/call; **bare calls default to upload/mapping metadata columns — always pass `fields`**) |
| `start_aggregation_by_alias` / `start_aggregation_by_id` → poll `get_aggregation_result_by_*(handle)` | grouped totals with no row cap (only path to per-value frequencies and null counts) |

There is no server-side anomaly tool. The agent computes outlier flags,
severity, duplicate counts, null rates, rare-value detection, and the
Data Quality Score **client-side** from those aggregates. State the
provenance of every number in the report so the user can re-derive it
manually if they want.

The agent operates on the **ungated** aliased and raw-by-id layers — no
feature-flag dependency. Discovery is alias-first: `list_data_models`,
then `list_aliased_fields` + the by-alias tools when a table has an
alias, else `get_fields_by_id` + the by-id tools. Quality stays the same
regardless of an org's flag state.

## When to use

- Data quality assessment for ANY Finance OS table
- Automated anomaly detection without manual configuration
- Routine data-quality monitoring (daily / weekly / monthly)
- Pre-close validation before month-end processes
- Exploratory analysis of unfamiliar tables

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Authenticate and resolve the target table

1. Verify Datarails connection. If a tool errors with auth, tell the
   user to connect via the Connectors UI and stop.
2. Resolve the target table — the agent discovers it inline, no profile
   or setup step. **If you were given an explicit table id (or already
   discovered the financials table earlier in THIS conversation), reuse
   it — skip the rest of this step.**

   - **Invoked with an explicit table id:** use it directly as
     `<table_id>`. No discovery, no name-matching — the caller named the
     table. This works for any table, financial or not.
   - **Otherwise:** call `list_data_models` and pick the financials
     table — the one whose name (or alias) matches
     `/financial|cube|p&?l|ledger|gl/i`; if none match, the largest by
     row count. Note **both** its numeric `id` and its `alias` (alias may
     be empty); prefer the alias path when present. Call it `<table_id>`.
     If no table matches the pattern, list what you found and ask the user
     which one to analyze before running heavy aggregations.

### Phase 2: Gather baseline aggregates

> **Async fetch — aggregations and distinct values run as start → poll.** `start_aggregation_by_id`/`_by_alias` and `start_distinct_values_by_id`/`_by_alias` take the same arguments as the retired blocking calls (dimensions/metrics/filters; table id + field id, or alias + field alias) and return immediately with `{"status": "pending", "handle": {...}}`. Echo that `handle` back verbatim to the matching `get_aggregation_result_by_*` / `get_distinct_values_result_by_*` tool: a `{"status": "running", "retry_after_seconds": N}` response means poll again with the same handle after ~N seconds (≈5s) — it is not an error, and large jobs may take several polls; when ready, the result arrives in the familiar shape (for distinct values, pass `limit` to the result tool). An expired/unknown-handle error means restart with the `start_*` tool. *Transitional fallback:* if the `start_*` tools aren't available on the connector (older server), the blocking twins `get_aggregated_data_by_*` / `get_distinct_values_by_*` still work with the same arguments.

In parallel where possible:

1. Fields — if the table has an alias, `list_aliased_fields(<alias>)`
   (business-friendly aliases); otherwise `get_fields_by_id(<table_id>)`
   (capture each field's numeric `id` — the by-id tools need ids).
   This gives field names, types, total row count. The analysis is
   **field-agnostic**: it profiles whatever numeric and categorical
   fields the schema exposes, so no semantic field binding is required.
   Take grouping dimensions straight from this schema. If a
   category-aware finding (rare-value, future-dated) needs the account
   dimension's distinct values, collect them via
   `start_distinct_values_by_alias(<alias>, <account_alias>)` (or the
   by-id twin `start_distinct_values_by_id(<table_id>, <account_field_id>)`)
   → poll the matching `get_distinct_values_result_by_*(handle)` until
   ready (async-fetch pattern).
   If a distinct call errors, fall back to
   `get_data_by_alias(<alias>, select=[<account_alias>], limit=500)` (or
   the by-id twin) and dedup client-side.
2. `profile_numeric_fields(<table_id>)` — SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX/COUNT per
   numeric field. **Reading the response:** it arrives in the
   backend-native `DR_Values`/`col_keys`/`row_keys` layout — no
   aggregator label on individual values, and values can appear
   duplicated per stat. Map each value to its statistic via the keys
   before labeling anything; never report a number as MIN/MAX/AVG/COUNT
   without confirming its key. If the mapping is ambiguous, anchor it by
   cross-checking ONE field with `start_aggregation_by_alias` /
   `start_aggregation_by_id` (MIN and MAX in two separate calls — one
   aggregation per field per call) → poll the matching
   `get_aggregation_result_by_*(handle)` until ready (async-fetch
   pattern) before deriving outliers or ranges.
3. `profile_categorical_fields(<table_id>, fields=[...])` — pass an
   **explicit `fields` list of business dimensions taken from the
   Phase 2 schema** (account-hierarchy levels, scenario,
   entity/department-like, date). Omitting `fields` profiles the table's
   upload/mapping metadata columns (tab/label/user/mapper-style
   bookkeeping fields), which says nothing about the data — never call
   it bare. The tool also silently caps at 5 fields/call; loop as needed
   to cover all business dimensions.
4. For each candidate-key or category field:
   `start_aggregation_by_alias(<alias>, dimensions=[<field_alias>],
   metrics=[{"field": <amount_field_alias>, "agg": "COUNT"}])` (or the by-id
   twin `start_aggregation_by_id(<table_id>, dimensions=[<field_id>],
   metrics=[{"field_id": <amount_field_id>, "agg": "COUNT"}])`) → poll the
   matching `get_aggregation_result_by_*(handle)` until ready (async-fetch
   pattern). **COUNT a
   different dense field (e.g. the discovered amount field) than the GROUP BY
   dimension itself — a same-field COUNT of the grouped dimension can 500.**
   This is the only source of per-value frequencies, null counts, and the
   inputs for duplicate / rare-value detection. Remember the response ends
   with a keyless grand-total row — exclude it from frequency math.

   **Aggregation-field failures are handled reactively, not pre-probed:**
   if a call 500s on a dimension field, re-inspect the Phase 2 schema for
   a sibling account-level field from the discovered schema (orgs often
   carry in-between levels) and retry; if an
   alias call fails, fall back to the by-id twin. If no sibling works,
   tell the user which field failed.

### Phase 3: Compute findings client-side

Apply the recipes from the `/dr-anomalies` skill (kept in sync — see
`skills/anomalies/SKILL.md`):

- **Range outliers (numeric):** flag values outside
  `[AVG - (MAX-MIN), AVG + (MAX-MIN)]`, using the **key-mapped** stats
  from Phase 2 (a mislabeled MAX-as-AVG produces garbage bands). Coarse
  substitute for `|z| > 3` because std dev isn't returned. Severity by
  absolute count and percentage of total.
- **Null / missing values:** sum the null bucket COUNT from the
  aggregation start→poll GROUP BY (`start_aggregation_by_*` →
  `get_aggregation_result_by_*`)
  divided by total rows (or filter directly with an advanced `is null`
  condition). ≥10% on a non-nullable field → CRITICAL; ≥1% → HIGH.
- **Duplicates:** pick a candidate composite key, GROUP BY that key
  with COUNT, client-side filter for COUNT > 1. Duplicates of a
  presumed primary key → CRITICAL.
- **Rare categorical values:** flag values below a small absolute or
  percentage threshold. Usually LOW or MEDIUM unless the field is a
  required dimension.
- **Future-dated rows:** filter the date field directly with an advanced
  range condition (`total_range` with epoch-second strings), or GROUP BY
  the date dimension and inspect for values beyond today.
- **Out of scope:** referential integrity (no joins via Finance OS
  API), per-character data hygiene (would need full-row scans
  beyond the 500-row filter limit). Note these honestly if asked.

### Phase 4: Score and report

1. Bucket findings into Critical / High / Medium / Low.
2. Data Quality Score (skill-computed, not server-supplied):

   ```
   Score = 100 - (critical × 10 + high × 5 + medium × 2 + low × 0.5)
   Clamped to [0, 100].
   ```

3. Health label: ≥90 Excellent, 80–89 Good, 70–79 Fair, 60–69 Poor,
   <60 Critical.

### Phase 5: Generate the Excel workbook

Write a Python script that builds the workbook with `openpyxl` and
execute it via `Bash`. The MCP server does NOT render Excel — that's
client-side. Apply Datarails brand styling: Poppins font (fallback
Calibri), navy banner `#0C142B`, content starts at column B, freeze
panes at B7, every cell typeset.

Sheets:
1. **Summary** — Data Quality Score, severity counts, top 5 findings.
2. **Critical Findings** — items the agent classified Critical.
3. **High Priority** — items the agent classified High.
4. **Numeric Analysis** — per-field MIN/MAX/AVG/COUNT (from the tool,
   key-mapped from the `DR_Values` response per Phase 2)
   plus skill-derived range-band outlier flag column. Std dev column
   blank with footnote: "not returned by the API; range used as a
   coarse substitute."
5. **Categorical Analysis** — distinct counts and skill-derived
   frequencies / null rates.
6. **Sample Records** — actual rows fetched via `get_data_by_alias` /
   `get_data_by_id` with IN-list IDs identified in Phase 3.

### Phase 6: Deliver

- Save to `tmp/Anomaly_Report_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.xlsx` unless the user
  specified an `--output` path.
- Print a one-screen summary (severity counts + DQ score + path).
- Suggest next steps that use the filter API: drill into IDs via
  `/dr-query <table_id> <key> IN (...)`, or use an advanced comparison /
  range filter directly when that fits the finding (both value-list and
  advanced filters are supported).

## Example summary output

```

## Behavioral characteristics

- **Proactive but honest:** explores unfamiliar data autonomously and
  tells the user which numbers came from the tool versus the skill.
- **Self-contained:** discovers the table and fields inline from the
  live schema (or uses an explicitly supplied table id); requires no
  saved profile or setup step.
- **Backward-compatible:** uses only the ungated aliased and raw-by-id
  layers. Orgs without semantic/metric Unleash flags get full quality.
- **Actionable:** every finding includes a re-derivation path and a
  suggested next-step query that uses the filter API (value-list or
  advanced comparison/range/null conditions).

## Performance notes

- Small tables (<10K rows): ~30 seconds
- Medium tables (10–100K rows): ~1–2 minutes
- Large tables (100K+ rows): ~5–10 minutes

Per-field aggregations run via the async-polling pipeline; the limiter
is usually how many fields we group by, not row count.
